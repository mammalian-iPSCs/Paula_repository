# Advancing regulatory variant effect prediction with AlphaGenome

First author: Žiga Avsec

Last author: Pushmeet Kohli

## First pass:

Read the title, abstract, introduction, headers and conclusions.

Write here what is the paper about:
> The paper is about AlphaGenome, a model made with AI that reads the DNA sequencies and predicts how the genes work. It can process huge fragments of DNA and predicts with a lot of precision if a change on the DNA will afect our health (analizing many biological functions as the activation of genes or RNA cutting and splicing)

**Category: What type of paper is it?**

Research article using bioinformatics and computational genomics

**Context: What work does it relate to?**

Is related with Enformer, Borzoi and SpliceIA. Some of them can watch long fragments of DNA but without precision, and some others the other way around. So Alphagenome tries to have both things

**Correctnes: Are assumptions valid?**

Yes, the model was trained using real human and mouse genomes. To ensure the results were accurate, scientists tested it with external validation and demonstrated that its predictions matched real laboratory experiments and variants known to cause disease.

**Contributions: What's new?**

As we comment, huge fragments of DNA predicted with a lot of precision.

Also unifies DNA sequence-to-function model, is the first time that a model predict 11 diferent types of biological functions simultaneously.

Splicing prediction: It introduces a new way to predict RNA binding, which helps to better understand rare genetic diseases.

For variant effect prediction AlphaGenome matched or outperformed the external models on 25 of 26 evaluations (surpassing previous models)

**Clarity: Is it well written?**

Yes


## Second pass:

Check the figures and diagrams, the main arguments and results and important reference.

Write here the main ideas and their evidence (no need of details, summarize the paper to someone else):

## Third pass:
Read everything in detail and virtually re-implement the work. 

**Is the logic correct? Is there any incorrect assumption?** 

**Would you do something different?**

**Are there any hidden assumptions?**
