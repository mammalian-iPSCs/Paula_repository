# Set up for the Transfer Learning of Pluripotency TF

## 1. Clone the repository
First, download the project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mammalian-iPSCs/Paula_repository.git

cd Paula_repository
```

## 2. Create the virtual environment

To ensure that the AlphaGenome analysis and Yamanaka factor study are reproducible, we will use a Python virtual environment.

We created an isolated environment to avoid conflicts between libraries. Follow these steps to set up your terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update # in case you need it
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv venv
```

## 2. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate # linux/macOS
.\venv\Scripts\activate # windows
```

## 3. Libraries needed

Once the environment is activated, we will install the necessary tools for genomic analysis and the use of AlphaGenome. We will be adding this libraries on the [requierments](https://github.com/mammalian-iPSCs/Paula_repository/blob/main/lab-notebooks/requirements.txt) doc. Copy and paste the following command: (ANAR ACTUALITZANT)

```bash
pip install "numpy>=1.24.0" "pandas>=2.0.0" "biopython>=1.80" "pybedtools>=0.9.0" jupyterlab
```
* **NumPy and Pandas:** Essential for processing the genomic tracks (biological signal data) generated by AlphaGenome.

* **BioPython:** Allows manipulation of the 1 Mb DNA sequences that serve as input for the model.

* **PyBedTools:** Essential for performing LiftOver, allowing us to map coordinates between different mammalian genomes and find orthologous regions.

* **JupyterLab:** Our interactive development environment for running experiments step by step.
